# First portfolio website - it taught me a couple of things, but most importantly:

- To keep the environment clean because as soon as it gets out of control it can completely mess up the whole look of the project.

## Since I moved from react-apps to next-js-apps, I no longer see any profit in cleaning this project + I am working on a new portfolio website with THREE JS, which sooner or later will render this website useless.
